#' ### Get the finalised identifications
#'
#' #### Explanation of confirmed and finalised identifications (copied from data exploration section)
#' All specimens were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Many small nymphs could not be
#' identified to species level. Furthermore, some adults could only be identified to genus or a higher
#' taxonomic level due to hard-to-distinguish features or contradictory features. All specimens identified
#' to one particular taxa had a "confirmed" identification.
#'
#' In some cases, specimens could only be identified to one of a set of multiple taxa, for
#' instance where contradictory features in the keys meant that they could be identified to one of two
#' particular taxa. An identification was "finalised" when a specimen could be identified to a number of
#' taxa.
#'
#' In parts of the analysis, the observations will referred to as confirmed or finalised, and be subset
#' according to these different types of identification.

plot(linear_regression_species_richness)

#' <br>Comments about assumptions:
#' <ul>* <em>linear relationship between elevation band and species richness</em>: according to the
#' scatterplot above, the relationship does not appear to be strongly linear, although there is not a
#' strong non-linear relationship either.
#' * <em>independence</em>: the plot of residuals shows a fairly random pattern indicating that a linear
#' model could be suitable.
#' * <em>heteroscedasticity</em>: looking at the Residuals vs Fitted plot above, there does not seem to be
#' any trend of increasing residuals as the fitted values increase, therefore this assumption seems to be
#' satisfied.
#' * <em>normally-distributed residuals</em>: the residuals appear to have a normal distribution (Q-Q plot
#' above) in general, but the point which corresponds to the highest species richness, seems to
#' be a bit of an outlier, skewing the distribution somewhat.
#' </ul>
#'
#' ### Plot linear regression
#' The plot below shows the species richness at each site (blue dots). Upper and lower bounds of the
#' predicted values are bounded within the grey area. The blue line represents the linear relationship
#' between species richness ($SR$) and elevation ($E$), which can be represented by the equation,
#' $SR = 16.90 - 0.006E$.

plot_linear_regression_species_richness(species_richness_sites, linear_regression_species_richness)

#' ### Test linear regression using t-test
#' Use a one-way t-test to check if there is a statistically significant relationship between the response
#' and explanatory variables.
#' <br>H<sub>0</sub>: the slope of the regression is equal to 0.
#' <br>H<sub>1</sub>: the slope of the regression is not equal to 0.
#'
#' Looking again at the model output above, we can see that the slope is not equal to 0
#' (<em>p</em> = 0.0004), therefore we can say there is a significant relationship between the species
#' richness and elevation.
#'
#' ## Check the regression if non-conservative identifications are used

#' Some specimens were identified to one of multiple species or genus, because of, for example, missing or
#' contradictory features. These are used in a conservative way in the analysis above. This part of the
#' analysis will check if there is any difference to the relationship between species richness and
#' elevation, if the less conservative identifications are used.
#'
#' ### Linear regression

#' Create a linear model of species richness against elevation and look at the model output.

#' richness decreases by 6.6 with an increase in elevation of 1000 m (<em>t</em> = -4.53,
#' <em>p</em> = 0.0001).
#'
#' ### Test for statistical significance between regressions
#'
#' Use a hypothesis test to check for any statistical difference between the slopes of the regressions
#' with the conservative and non-conservative identifications.
#' H0: regression lines are parallel.
#' H1: regression lines are not parallel.
#'
#' **TODO**: would it be valid to use ANCOVA for this? The values would not be independent because they are
#' from the same sites.
#'
#' ## Account for the effects of sampling effort
#'
#' Due to logistical reasons and poor weather, the sampling effort varied a lot across the sampling sites.
#' Additionally, both and hand and net sampling were used. In order to account for the difference in
#' sampling effort across the sites, an index of sampling effort was calculated.
#'
#' First, the proportion of all specimens captured by hand ($prop_{hand}$) and by net ($prop_{net}$)
#' was calculated. Secondly, the index for sampling effort was calculated for each site according
#' to the following equation: $$weighting = obs_{hand} * prop_{hand} + obs_{net} * prop_{net}$$ where
#' $obs_{hand}$ and $obs_{net}$ were the number of specimens captured at the site by each sampling
#' method.

#' ## Results
#'
#' <br>A simple linear regression was used to investigate the relationship between elevation and species richness.
#' Overall species richness and elevation were negatively correlated (Pearson's correlation coefficient
#' = -0.63). Species richness was shown to decrease by 5.7 for an increase in elevation of 1000 m
#' (<em>t</em> = -4.11; <em>p</em> = 0.0004). However, only 39% of the variation in species richness can
#' be explained by elevation (<em>F</em> = 16.89; <em>df</em> = 1, 26; <em>p</em> = 0.0004).
#'
#' **TODO**: add details of effects of sampling effort.
#'
#' Looking at the plot of the species richness coloured by study area, there seems to be a strong decrease
#' in species richness with elevation at both La Molinassa and Tavascan, but no change at Tor. A linear
#' mixed model fitting elevation as a fixed effect and study area as a random effect, was used to
#' investigate if there was any effect of study area on species richness. [**TODO**: add interpretation of
#' this]. Given the effect of area on species richness, simple linear regressions were used to model the
#' species richness with elevation within each study area separately. Whilst there was no relationship at
#' Tor (<em>r</em> = -0.30; <em>F</em> = 0.77; <em>df</em> = 1, 8; <em>p</em> = 0.41), a clear decrease in
#' species richness with elevation can be seen at La Molinassa (<em>r</em> = -0.80; <em>F</em> = 10.34;

#' Out of 37 species observed, 29 were Caelifera. A linear mixed model with elevation as a fixed effect
#' and study area as a random effect, to investigate if the relationship between species richness and
#' elevation followed a similar trend when using observations just of the Caelifera. Trends at all three
#' study areas were similar to those already reported, with no evidence of a relationship between
#' Caelifera species richness and elevation at Tor (<em>r</em> = -0.11; <em>F</em> = 0.09; <em>df</em> =
#' 1, 8; <em>p</em> = 0.77), but a clear and significant decrease with elevation at both La Molinassa
#' (<em>r</em> = -0.82; <em>F</em> = 12.35; <em>df</em> = 1, 6; <em>p</em> = 0.01) and Tavascan
#' (<em>r</em> = -0.97; <em>F</em> = 95.17; <em>df</em> = 1, 5; <em>p</em> = 0.0002).

#' ## Questions
#' <ol>
#'  <li>When reporting the decrease in species richness with elevation and variation explained (first
#' paragraph of results above), should both t and F be reported? Should the p-value only be reported
#' once?</li>
#'  <li>I'm not sure how to interpret the output of the linear mixed model with elevation as a fixed
#' effect and study area as a random effect
#' (https://falciot.net/orthoptera-94940/analysis_outputs/orthoptera_species_richness_hypothesis1.html#fit-a-linear-mixed-model).
#' How can I use this to say that from this result, we decided to look at the relationship for each study
#' area separately? In the output for area there are no p-values.</li>
#'  <li>In the same output, does it matter that the variance of area is very small (0)?</li>
#'  <li>To calculate <em>r</em> which is included in the last part of the results section above where we
#' report the relationships for modelling species richness separately for each study area, I have used the
#' multiple R-squared (rather than adjusted R-squared) output because I understand that we are not
#' adjusting for the number of predictors in the model. Is this correct or should I be using something else?</li>
