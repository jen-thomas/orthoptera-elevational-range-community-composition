# Investigating the relationship of elevation and Orthoptera species richness, elevational range and community composition. 

This repository contains the code to do the analysis for this project which was done in `R`. 

## Project structure

The code structure is a balance between trying to use functions to keep the code organised, and putting it together in a logical order so that when looking at the HTML files, there is not too much moving around within and between scripts. 

A virtual environment `Renv` encapsulates the packages used within the code. This should be activated before trying to use the code.

The directory `analysis_scripts` contains the R code to manipulate the data and do the analysis needed for each hypothesis. Running the script `generate_analysis_output.R` will create HTML files from each of the individual files. This provides a more human-friendly view of the comments, code and output. Output files (HTML and plot files that are generated) are not included in this repository because they can be generated by running the code. 

Contents of `analysis_scripts`: 
* `data_preparation.R`: various data manipulation functions which prepares the data for analysis
* `get_finalised_observations_species_richness_conservative.R`: read the details about finalised observations in the file. This code creates the set of observations that are used for the rest of the analysis
* `get_physical_site_data.R`: digital elevation models were used to get data for topography parameters at each of the study sites
* `orthoptera_community_composition_hypothesis3.R`: analysis of community composition using `vegan`. Non-hierarchical K-means cluster analysis and NMDS with ordination.
* `orthoptera elevation_data_exploration.R`: initial investigations of the data to summarise visits to sites, number of surveys and number of taxa found
* `orthoptera_elevational_range_hypothesis2.R`: nonlinear regressions used to analyse the relationship between elevational range over an elevational gradient (Rapoport's elevational rule)
* `orthoptera_species_richness_hypothesis1.R`: generalised linear models used to find the important predictors of species richness along the elevational gradient
* `prepare_vegetation_data.R`: vegetation structure was characterised along each transect. This code calculates the mean of each parameter for each transect
* `show_latest_commits.R`: get the lastest git commits for each of the R files to display (not really used anymore, but the idea was that it would show the last few commits so that there was no need to write a full summary)
* `utils.R`: some generic bits of code that can be used throughout the analysis
